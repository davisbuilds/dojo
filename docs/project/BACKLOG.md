# Improvement Backlog

Living list of future friction points, design gaps, and follow-up actions noticed
during normal repo work. Lightweight: items get added when they bite, removed
when they ship or prove not worth doing. This is not a release contract;
`docs/system/ROADMAP.md` is the higher-bar shipped/in-progress view.

Convention: each item has **What** (the friction), **Why it matters**, and
optionally **Sketch** (a one-line implementation thought). Status values:
`noted` / `in-progress` / `dropped`.

When an item ships, remove it from this doc and record it as a concise completed
highlight in `docs/system/ROADMAP.md` instead of keeping a shipped note here.
This file stays future-only.

## Open

#### Shared SemVer helper
Status: noted
- **What**: SemVer parsing/validation now exists in multiple scripts.
- **Why it matters**: The duplication is small, but future changes to prerelease
  or build-metadata handling could drift between validation, manifest generation,
  and version-bump checks.
- **Sketch**: Move the regex plus parse/compare helpers into a small importable
  module under `skills/skill-evals/scripts/` or `scripts/lib/`, then have
  validators and generators use the same implementation.

#### Skill version bump helper
Status: noted
- **What**: The release check requires authors to bump SKILL.md and add a
  changelog heading, but no command helps perform that edit.
- **Why it matters**: The policy is enforceable, but manual edits are repetitive
  and easy to get slightly wrong during frequent skill maintenance.
- **Sketch**: Add a small helper such as
  `python3 skills/skill-evals/scripts/bump_skill_version.py skills/api-design patch`
  that updates the top-level `version` field and prepends a `CHANGELOG.md`
  heading for the new release.

#### Changelog entry format hardening
Status: noted
- **What**: Version checks currently require a `CHANGELOG.md` heading containing
  the new version, but do not require dates or entry content.
- **Why it matters**: This keeps adoption friction low, but changelog quality may
  vary once skills start receiving regular releases.
- **Sketch**: After a few real version bumps, consider requiring headings like
  `## 1.2.3 - YYYY-MM-DD` plus at least one bullet under the heading.

#### Install/update workflows should understand skill versions
Status: noted
- **What**: The manifest and catalog now expose skill versions, but installer and
  standardizer workflows do not yet report available/current version deltas.
- **Why it matters**: Version metadata is most useful when sync and install tools
  can say whether a local copy is behind, ahead, or divergent.
- **Sketch**: Extend skill install/standardization reports to show source and
  destination versions alongside existing drift information.
