# gh-triage-issues

Triage GitHub issues: label, prioritize, detect duplicates, and assign.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed (`apt install gh` if missing)
- Authentication configured (`gh auth status` to verify)

## Workflow

### 1. Parse Input

Determine mode:

- **Single issue**: `owner/repo` + issue number
- **Batch triage**: `owner/repo` + filter (e.g., unlabeled issues)

### 2. Fetch Issue Details

```bash
bash scripts/fetch_issue.sh <owner/repo> <issue_number>
```

### 3. Get Available Labels

```bash
bash scripts/list_labels.sh <owner/repo>
```

Cache this per-repo; labels rarely change mid-session.

### 4. Check for Duplicates

Extract key terms from title/body, then search:

```bash
bash scripts/find_duplicates.sh <owner/repo> "<key terms>"
```

**If likely duplicate found:**

- Comment linking to original issue
- Add `duplicate` label
- Close issue (with user confirmation)
- Stop triage here

### 5. Classify Issue Type

Determine primary type from content:

| Type       | Indicators                                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bug`      | "error", "crash", "doesn't work", "broken", stack traces |
| `feature`  | "add", "would be nice", "request", "enhancement"         |
| `docs`     | "documentation", "typo", "README", "unclear"             |
| `question` | "how do I", "is it possible", "?", support-style asks    |
| `security` | "vulnerability", "CVE", "exploit", "injection"           |
| `chore`    | "upgrade", "dependency", "refactor", "tech debt"         |

### 6. Assess Priority

Evaluate based on:

| Signal                           | Priority Impact                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Security issue                   | → Critical                     |
| Data loss potential              | → Critical                     |
| Blocks many users                | → High                         |
| Workaround exists                | → Lower                        |
| Edge case                        | → Lower                        |
| Reactions (👍 count)             | Higher count → Higher priority |
| Author is maintainer/contributor | May indicate importance        |

**Priority labels** (adapt to repo conventions):

- `priority: critical` — Security, data loss, wide breakage
- `priority: high` — Significant impact, no workaround
- `priority: medium` — Normal bugs/features
- `priority: low` — Minor issues, nice-to-haves

### 7. Add Area/Component Labels

If repo uses area labels (e.g., `area/api`, `area/ui`, `component/auth`), identify from:

- File paths mentioned
- Keywords in description
- Stack traces

### 8. Apply Labels

```bash
gh issue edit <issue_number> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --add-label "bug,priority: high,area/api"
```

### 9. Assign (Optional)

If repo has CODEOWNERS or known maintainers per area:

```bash
gh issue edit <issue_number> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --add-assignee "<username>"
```

Only assign if:

- Clear owner for the area
- User requested assignment
- Following repo's assignment conventions

### 10. Post Triage Comment (Optional)

For complex issues or when clarification needed:

```bash
gh issue comment <issue_number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "<comment>"
```

**Comment templates:**

_Needs more info:_

```markdown
Thanks for reporting! To help us investigate, could you provide:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, version, etc.)
```

_Duplicate detected:_

```markdown
This appears to be a duplicate of #<original>. Closing in favor of that issue.
Please add any additional context there. Reopen if this is actually distinct.
```

_Triaged successfully:_

```markdown
Triaged: labeled as `<labels>`, priority `<priority>`.
<optional: assigned to @user or "Added to backlog for future planning.">
```

### 11. Report Summary

Provide user with:

- Labels applied
- Priority assessment rationale
- Duplicates found (if any)
- Assignment (if made)
- Any questions/blockers

## Batch Triage Mode

To triage multiple issues:

```bash
# List unlabeled open issues
gh issue list --repo <owner/repo> --label "" --state open --limit 20
```

Then loop through each, applying the single-issue workflow.

For large backlogs, summarize findings:

```markdown
## Triage Summary

| Issue | Type | Priority | Labels Applied | Notes        |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| #42   | bug  | high     | bug, area/api  | —            |
| #43   | dup  | —        | duplicate      | Dup of #12   |
| #44   | feat | medium   | enhancement    | Needs design |
```

## Edge Cases

**Issue lacks detail**: Label `needs-info`, post comment requesting details, don't set priority yet.

**Security issue**: Label `security`, set critical priority, avoid discussing details publicly. Suggest private disclosure if repo supports it.

**Issue is actually a PR or discussion**: Redirect author to correct venue, close issue.

**Author is first-time contributor**: Be welcoming in tone; they may not know repo conventions.

**Contentious/heated issue**: Triage factually; don't engage in debates. Flag for maintainer attention if needed.
